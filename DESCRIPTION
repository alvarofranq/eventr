Description: Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm where the flow of execution is defined by event.
    In this paradigm an event can be defined as "a change in the state" of an object. This package offers a set
    of functions for creating event-based architectures using three basic functions: events, dispatchers, and
    handlers. The handlers manage the events, the dispatchers are in charge of redirecting the events to each of
    the handlers, finally the events are the objects that carry the information about the change of state.
